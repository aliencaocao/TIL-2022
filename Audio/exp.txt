effecient net v2s no db norm, 9k files (removed bad files), 20 epoch: 7232
effecient net v2s with db norm, 9531 files (after fixed bad files using norm), 20 epoch: 7331
all exp below uses 9531 files

effecient net v2s with no aug, crashed at 11 epoch but reducelronplaetu set to 3 (prev was 4): 7593-> improvement might be caused by callback change
effecient net v2s with no aug, 20 epoch with consine decay (20 * 477 steps), no reducelr (cannot use tger): 7577, overfits hard to 0.9977 on train
effecient net v2s with aug, 20 epoch with consine decay (20 * 477 steps), no reducelr (cannot use tger): 7420, overfits hard to 0.9929 on train
---seems like LR scheduler lead to more overfit on train but val doesnt hurt a lot
effecient net v2s with aug, 20 epoch with reducelr=3, no schedule: 7441, seems no aug improves a bit
